# Gases Intro - implementation notes

_Gases Intro_ is based on the _Gas Properties_ simulation.

The _Intro_ screen is a variation of the _Ideal_ screen, with the "Hold Constant" radio buttons hidden.

The _Laws_ screen is identical to the _Ideal_ screen.

In _Gas Properties_, pressure noise is _on_ by default. In this sim, pressure noise if _off_ by default.  
If desired, it can be enabled using query parameter `pressureNoise=true`.
